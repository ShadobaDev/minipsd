# Changelog

Changes between releases, for users of minipsd. Versioning follows the pre-1.0 rules in
[TODO.md](TODO.md): breaking changes bump the MINOR, additions and fixes the PATCH.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The implementation moved out of `minipsd.h` into `include/minipsd/`; `minipsd.h` keeps the
  whole public API. If you copy the header into your tree, copy the `include/` directory instead,
  or take the single-file `minipsd.h` attached to each release.
- The SBOM fragment lists every header with its checksums.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-12

### Added
- First standalone release of the PSD writer extracted from Platemaker.
